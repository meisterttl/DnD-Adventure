# DnD-Adventure
Making this game was not part of my second JavaScript project for the class; rather it was about creating a simple JavaScript/jQuery tutorial explaining several aspects of the language or how to use certain useful plugins.

My chosen topic for the project was about Random Number Generator, and what better way to demonstrate how RNG works than a game?

So I made a really simple Roll-Playing Game using Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition system. Wish I had more time to work on this project; maybe then, I could've come up with my own system but I was given less than 3 weeks and had to borrow the system from Wizard of the Coase. So, please, WotC, do not sue me.

I will eventually modify the game to avoid copyright infringement and improve the efficiency. Got 99% for my tutorial project and this game was part of it.
